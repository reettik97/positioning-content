                <p>these two divs are positioned next to one

                <p>Notice the space between them. It occurs because
                    of my carriage return in the HTML
                    which I've used to keep the code organized.
                    I've used a reset to insure no element
                    should have any default margins or padding.
                    (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier
                    to read.) This space is actually a space
                    character rendered just as it would
                    between two inline elements.

            <div class="inline-block-box float-left">You can see that, even though the elements
                    are spaced in the code. the space is not
                    actually rendered on the page. This rnay not be a
                    a huge deal in these first examples, but.â€ž

                <p>the two elements are side-by-side just as I
                        intended and fill the entire width of the parent
                        (which, in this case, is the same as the width of
                        the viewport.

                        up the full width of the parent element? I can set
                        the width of each to 50%. right?

                <p>Wrong! Because. together. the two inline block
                        elements will add up to 100% of the available
                        width, but that doesn't account for the space
                        between.
